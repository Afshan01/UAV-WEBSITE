              <p>UAV-ZHCET is a ZHCET based venture to acquaint students with the art and techniques of designing and developing unmanned aerial vehicles. UAVs are fast emerging as a solution to many problems of practical significance - from surveillance to disaster relief to weather forecasting, etc. At UAV-ZHCET, our aim has been to develop a center for emanation and advancement of UAV based technologies.</p>

              <p>Being amongst the founding members of the club, I have seen it grow from a little plantlet to spreading its roots across the university and outside, while being bounded by limited resources. UAV-ZHCET has successfully organized several workshops on drone design and participated in TechnoXian - World Robotics Championship. The club is run by enthusiastic students with a passion to make a difference and bring AMU to the forefront of research and development in UAVs. I wish the club success in all its endeavors.</p>
